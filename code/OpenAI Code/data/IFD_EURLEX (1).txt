DIRECTIVE (EU) 2019/2034 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL
of 27 November 2019
on the prudential supervision of investment firms and amending Directives 2002/87/EC,
2009/65/EC, 2011/61/EU, 2013/36/EU, 2014/59/EU and 2014/65/EU
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 53(1) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (2),
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (3),
Whereas:
(1) Robust prudential supervision is an integral part of the regulatory conditions under which financial institutions
provide services within the Union. Investment firms are, together with credit institutions, subject to Regulation (EU)
No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) and to Directive 2013/36/EU of the European
Parliament and of the Council (5) as regards their prudential treatment and supervision, while their authorisation
and other organisational and conduct requirements are set out in Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament
and of the Council (6).
(2) The existing prudential regimes under Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and Directive 2013/36/EU are largely based on
successive iterations of the international regulatory standards set for large banking groups by the Basel Committee
on Banking Supervision and only partially address the specific risks inherent to the diverse activities of a large
number of investment firms. The specific vulnerabilities and risks inherent to those investment firms should
therefore be further addressed by means of effective, appropriate and proportionate prudential arrangements at
Union level which help to provide a level playing field across the Union, which guarantee effective prudential
supervision while keeping compliance costs in check, and which ensure sufficient capital for the risks of investment
firms.
(3) Sound prudential supervision should ensure that investment firms are managed in an orderly way and in the best
interests of their clients. It should take into account the potential for investment firms and their clients to engage in
excessive risk‐taking and the different degrees of risk assumed and posed by investment firms. Equally, such
prudential supervision should aim to avoid imposing a disproportionate administrative burden on investment
firms. At the same time, such prudential supervision should make it possible to strike a balance between ensuring
the safety and soundness of investment firms and avoiding excessive costs that might undermine the viability of
their business activities.

8 November 2019.
(4) Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on prudential requirements for credit
institutions and investment firms and amending Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 (OJ L 176, 27.6.2013, p. 1).
(5) Directive 2013/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on access to the activity of credit institutions
and the prudential supervision of credit institutions and investment firms, amending Directive 2002/87/EC and repealing Directives
2006/48/EC and 2006/49/EC (OJ L 176, 27.6.2013, p. 338).
(6) Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 on markets in financial instruments and
amending Directive 2002/92/EC and Directive 2011/61/EU (OJ L 173, 12.6.2014, p. 349).

(4) Many of the requirements that stem from the framework of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and Directive
2013/36/EU are designed to address common risks faced by credit institutions. Accordingly, the existing
requirements are largely calibrated to preserve the lending capacity of credit institutions through economic cycles
and to protect depositors and taxpayers from possible failure, and are not designed to address all of the different
risk profiles of investment firms. Investment firms do not have large portfolios of retail and corporate loans and do
not take deposits. The likelihood that their failure can have detrimental impacts on overall financial stability is lower
than in the case of credit institutions, but investment firms nevertheless pose a risk which is necessary to address by
means of a robust framework. The risks faced and posed by most investment firms are thus substantially different to
the risks faced and posed by credit institutions and such differences should be clearly reflected in the prudential
framework of the Union.
(5) Differences in the application of the existing prudential framework in different Member States threaten the level
playing field for investment firms within the Union, hampering the access of investors to new opportunities and
better ways of managing their risks. Those differences stem from the overall complexity of the application of the
framework to different investment firms based on the services that they provide, where some national authorities
adjust or streamline such application in national law or practice. Given that the existing prudential framework does
not address all the risks faced and posed by some types of investment firms, large capital add‐ons have been applied
to certain investment firms in some Member States. Uniform provisions addressing those risks should be established
in order to ensure harmonised prudential supervision of investment firms across the Union.
(6) A specific prudential regime is therefore required for investment firms which are not systemic by virtue of their size
and their interconnectedness with other financial and economic actors. Systemic investment firms should, however,
remain subject to the existing prudential framework under Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and Directive
2013/36/EU. Those investment firms are a subset of investment firms to which the framework laid down in
Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and in Directive 2013/36/EU currently applies and which do not benefit from
dedicated exemptions from any of their principle requirements. The largest and most interconnected investment
firms have business models and risk profiles that are similar to those of significant credit institutions. They provide
“bank‐like” services and underwrite risks at significant scale. Furthermore, systemic investment firms are large
enough to, and have business models and risk profiles which, represent a threat for the stable and orderly
functioning of financial markets on a par with large credit institutions. Therefore it is appropriate that those
investment firms remain subject to the provisions set out in Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and Directive
2013/36/EU.
(7) It is possible that investment firms which deal on own account, which underwrite financial instruments or place
financial instruments on a firm commitment basis on a significant scale, or which are clearing members in central
counterparties, have business models and risk profiles that are similar to those of credit institutions. Given their size
and activities, it is possible that such investment firms present comparable risks to financial stability as credit
institutions. Competent authorities should have the option of requiring them to remain subject to the same
prudential treatment as credit institutions that fall within the scope of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and to
compliance with prudential supervision under Directive 2013/36/EU.
(8) There may be Member States in which the authorities competent for the prudential supervision of investment firms
are different from the authorities that are competent for the supervision of market conduct. It is therefore necessary
to create a mechanism of cooperation and exchange of information between those authorities in order to ensure
harmonised prudential supervision of investment firms across the Union which functions promptly and efficiently.
(9) An investment firm may trade via a clearing member in another Member State. Where it does so, a mechanism for
sharing information between the relevant competent authorities in the different Member States should be put in
place. Such a mechanism should allow the sharing of information between the competent authority for the
prudential supervision of the investment firm and either the authority supervising the clearing member or the
authority supervising the central counterparty on the model and parameters used for the calculation of the margin
requirements of the investment firm where such method of calculation is used as the basis for the investment firm’s
own funds requirements.

(10) To foster the harmonisation of supervisory standards and practices within the Union, the European Supervisory
Authority (European Banking Authority) established by Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament
and of the Council (7) (EBA) should, in close cooperation with the European Supervisory Authority (European
Securities and Markets Authority) established by Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of
the Council (8) (ESMA), retain primary competence for the coordination and convergence of supervisory practices in
the area of prudential supervision over investment firms within the European System for Financial Supervision
(ESFS).
(11) The required level of initial capital of an investment firm should be based on the services and activities which that
investment firm is authorised to provide and perform, respectively, according to Directive 2014/65/EU. The
possibility for Member States to lower the required level of initial capital in specific situations, as provided for in
Directive 2013/36/EU on the one hand, and the situation of uneven implementation of that Directive on the other
hand, have led to a situation where the required level of initial capital diverges across the Union. To end that
fragmentation, the required level of initial capital should be harmonised for all investment firms in the Union. With
a view to reducing barriers to market entry that currently exist for the multilateral trading facilities (MTFs) and
organised trading facilities (OTFs), the initial capital of investment firms that operate an MTF or an OTF should be
set at the level referred to in this Directive. Where an investment firm authorised to operate an OTF has been
permitted to also engage in dealing on own account under the conditions provided for in Article 20 of Directive
2014/65/EU its initial capital should be set at the level referred to in this Directive.
(12) Although investment firms should no longer fall within the scope of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 or Directive
2013/36/EU, certain concepts used in the context of those legislative acts should retain their well‐established
meaning. To enable and facilitate the consistent reading of such concepts in Union legal acts when used, references
in such acts to the initial capital of investment firms, to the supervisory powers of competent authorities for
investment firms, to the internal capital adequacy assessment process of investment firms, to the supervisory review
and evaluation process of competent authorities for investment firms, and to governance and remuneration
provisions applicable to investment firms should be construed as referring to the corresponding provisions in this
Directive.
(13) The proper functioning of the internal market requires that the responsibility for prudential supervision of an
investment firm, in particular in relation to its solvency and its financial soundness, lies with the competent
authority of its home Member State. In order also to achieve effective supervision of investment firms in other
Member States, where they provide services or have a branch, close cooperation and exchange of information with
the competent authorities of those Member States should be ensured.
(14) For information and supervisory purposes, and in particular to ensure the stability of the financial system,
competent authorities of host Member States should be able, on a case‐by‐case basis, to carry out on‐the‐spot
checks and inspect the activities of branches of investment firms on their territory, and to require information
about the activities of those branches. Supervisory measures for those branches should, however, remain the
responsibility of the home Member State.
(15) To protect commercially sensitive information, competent authorities should be bound by rules of professional
secrecy when conducting their supervisory tasks and when exchanging confidential information.
(16) To strengthen the prudential supervision of investment firms and the protection of clients of investment firms,
auditors should carry out their verification impartially and report promptly to the competent authorities those facts
which can have a serious effect on the financial situation of an investment firm or on its administrative and
accounting organisation.
(7) Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 establishing a European
Supervisory Authority (European Banking Authority), amending Decision No 716/2009/EC and repealing Commission Decision
2009/78/EC (OJ L 331, 15.12.2010, p. 12).
(8) Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 establishing a European
Supervisory Authority (European Securities and Markets Authority), amending Decision No 716/2009/EC and repealing Commission
Decision 2009/77/EC (OJ L 331, 15.12.2010, p. 84).
5.12.2019 E N O f f i c i a l J o u r n a l o f t h e E u r o p e a n Union L 314/67
(17) For the purposes of this Directive, personal data should be processed in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679
of the European Parliament and of the Council (9), and with Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament
and of the Council (10). In particular, where this Directive allows for exchanges of personal data with third countries,
the relevant provisions of Chapter V of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and Chapter V of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725
should apply.
(18) To safeguard compliance with the obligations laid down in this Directive and Regulation (EU) 2019/2033 of the
European Parliament and of the Council (11), Member States should provide for administrative sanctions and other
administrative measures which are effective, proportionate and dissuasive. In order to ensure that administrative
sanctions have a dissuasive effect they should be published except in certain well‐defined circumstances. To enable
clients and investors to make an informed decision about their investment options, those clients and investors
should have access to information on administrative sanctions and other administrative measures imposed on
investment firms.
(19) To detect breaches of national provisions transposing this Directive and breaches of Regulation (EU) 2019/2033,
Member States should have the necessary investigatory powers and should establish effective and rapid mechanisms
to report potential or actual breaches.
(20) Investment firms which are not considered to be small and non‐interconnected should have available internal capital
which is adequate in quantity, quality and distribution to cover the specific risks to which they are or may be
exposed. Competent authorities should ensure that investment firms have adequate strategies and processes in place
to assess and maintain the adequacy of their internal capital. Competent authorities should also be able to request
small and non‐interconnected investment firms to apply similar requirements where appropriate.
(21) Supervisory review and evaluation powers should continue to remain an important regulatory tool that allows
competent authorities to assess qualitative elements, including internal governance and controls, risk management
processes and procedures and, where needed, to set additional requirements, including in particular in relation to
own funds and liquidity requirements, in particular for investment firms which are not considered to be small and
non‐interconnected, and where the competent authority deems it to be justified and appropriate also for small and
non‐interconnected investment firms.
(22) The principle of equal pay for male and female workers for equal work or work of equal value is laid down in Article
157 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). That principle should be applied in a consistent
manner by investment firms. To align remuneration with the risk profile of investment firms and to guarantee a level
playing field, investment firms should be subject to clear principles with regard to corporate governance
arrangements and remuneration rules, which are gender neutral and which take into account the differences
between credit institutions and investment firms. Small and non‐interconnected investment firms should, however,
be exempt from those rules because the provisions on remuneration and corporate governance laid down in
Directive 2014/65/EU are sufficiently comprehensive for those types of investment firms.
(23) Similarly, the Commission report of 28 July 2016 on the assessment of the remuneration rules under Directive
2013/36/EU and Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 demonstrated that the requirements on deferral and pay‐out in
instruments laid down in Directive 2013/36/EU are not appropriate for small and non‐complex investment firms
or for staff with low levels of variable remuneration. Clear, consistent and harmonised criteria for identifying
investment firms and individuals that are exempt from those requirements are necessary to ensure supervisory
convergence and a level playing field. Given the important role that high earners play in directing the business and
long‐term performance of investment firms, effective oversight of the remuneration practices and trends relating to
high earners should be ensured. Therefore, competent authorities should be able to monitor the remuneration of
high earners.
(9) Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with
regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data
Protection Regulation) (OJ L 119, 4.5.2016, p. 1).
(10) Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2018 on the protection of natural persons
with regard to the processing of personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and on the free movement of
such data, and repealing Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and Decision No 1247/2002/EC (OJ L 295, 21.11.2018, p. 39).
(11) Regulation (EU) 2019/2033 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 November 2019 on the prudential requirements of
investment firms and amending Regulations (EU) No 1093/2010, (EU) No 575/2013, (EU) No 600/2014 and (EU) No 806/2014 (see
page 1 of this Official Journal).
L 314/68 E N O f f i c i a l J o u r n a l o f t h e E u r o p e a n Union 5.12.2019
(24) It is also appropriate to offer some flexibility to investment firms in the way investment firms use non‐cash
instruments to pay variable remuneration, provided that such instruments are effective in achieving the objective of
aligning the interests of staff with the interests of various stakeholders, such as shareholders and creditors, and
contribute to the alignment of variable remuneration with the risk profile of the investment firm.
(25) The revenues of investment firms in the form of fees, commissions and other revenues in relation to the provision of
different investment services are highly volatile. Limiting the variable component of remuneration to a portion of
the fixed component of remuneration would affect the investment firm’s ability to reduce remuneration at times of
reduced revenues and could lead to an increase of the investment firm’s fixed cost base, leading in turn to risks to
the investment firm’s ability to withstand times of economic downturn or reduced revenues. To avoid those risks, a
single maximum ratio between the variable and the fixed components of remuneration should not be imposed on
non‐systemic investment firms. Instead, those investment firms should set appropriate ratios themselves. However,
this Directive should not preclude Member States from implementing measures in national law designed to subject
investment firms to stricter requirements with regard to the maximum ratio between the variable and the fixed
components of the remuneration. Moreover, this Directive should not prevent Member States from imposing such a
maximum ratio on all or on specific types of investment firms.
(26) This Directive should not prevent Member States from adopting a stricter approach with regard to the remuneration
when investment firms receive extraordinary public financial support.
(27) Different governance structures are used across Member States. In most cases a unitary or a dual‐board structure is
used. The definitions laid down in this Directive are intended to embrace all existing structures without expressing a
preference for any particular structure. They are purely functional for the purpose of setting out rules aimed at a
particular outcome irrespective of the national company law applicable to an institution in each Member State. The
definitions should therefore not interfere with the general allocation of competences in accordance with national
company law.
(28) Management bodies should be understood to have executive and supervisory functions. The competence and
structure of management bodies differ across Member States. In Member States where management bodies have a
one‐tier structure, a single board usually performs management and supervisory tasks. In Member States with a
two‐tier system, the supervisory function is performed by a separate supervisory board which has no executive
functions and the executive function is performed by a separate management board which is responsible and
accountable for the day‐to‐day management of the undertaking. Accordingly, separate tasks are assigned to the
different entities within the management body.
(29) In response to the growing public demand for tax transparency, and to promote investment firms’ corporate
responsibility, it is appropriate to require that, unless they qualify as small and non‐interconnected, investment
firms disclose, on an annual basis, certain information, including information on profits made, taxes paid and any
public subsidies received.
(30) To address risks at investment firm only group level, the prudential consolidation method required by Regulation
(EU) 2019/2033 should in the case of investment firm only groups be accompanied by a group capital test for
simpler group structures. The determination of the group supervisor, however, should in both cases be based on the
same principles that apply in the case of supervision on a consolidated basis under Directive 2013/36/EU. To ensure
proper cooperation, core elements of coordination measures, and in particular information requirements in
emergency situations or cooperation and coordination arrangements should be similar to the core elements of
coordination applicable in the context of the single rulebook for credit institutions.
(31) The Commission should be able to submit recommendations to the Council for the negotiation of agreements
between the Union and third countries for the practical exercise of supervision of compliance with the group
capital test for investment firms, the parent undertakings of which are established in third countries, and for
investment firms operating in third countries the parent undertakings of which are established in the Union.
Moreover, Member States and EBA should also be able to set‐up cooperation arrangements with third countries to
perform their supervisory tasks.
5.12.2019 E N O f f i c i a l J o u r n a l o f t h e E u r o p e a n Union L 314/69
(32) In order to ensure legal certainty and avoid overlaps between the current prudential framework applicable to both
credit institutions and investment firms and this Directive, Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and Directive
2013/36/EU should be amended in order to remove investment firms from their scope. However, investment firms
which are part of a banking group should remain subject to those provisions in Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and
Directive 2013/36/EU which are relevant to the banking group, such as the rules on prudential consolidation set
out in Articles 11 to 24 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and the provisions on the intermediate EU parent
undertaking referred to in Article 21b of Directive 2013/36/EU.
(33) It is necessary to specify the steps that undertakings need to take to verify whether they fall under the definition of a
credit institution as set out in point (1)(b) of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and therefore need to
obtain authorisation as a credit institution. Because certain investment firms already carry out the activities listed in
points (3) and (6) of Section A of Annex I to Directive 2014/65/EU, it is also necessary to ensure clarity regarding the
continuity of any authorisation granted for those activities. In particular, it is essential that competent authorities
ensure that the transition from the current framework to the new one offers sufficient regulatory certainty for
investment firms.
(34) To ensure effective supervision, it is important that undertakings that meet the conditions set out in point (1)(b) of
Article 4(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 apply for an authorisation as a credit institution. Competent
authorities should therefore have the possibility to apply sanctions to undertakings that do not apply for that
authorisation.
(35) The amendment to the definition of ‘credit institution’ in Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 by Regulation (EU) 2019/
2033 may cover, from the entry into force of the latter, investment firms that are already operating on the basis of
an authorisation issued in accordance with Directive 2014/65/EU. Those undertakings should be allowed to
continue operating under their authorisation as investment firms until the authorisation of a credit institution is
granted. Those investment firms should submit an application for authorisation as a credit institution at the latest
when the average of their monthly total assets is equal to or exceeds any of the thresholds set out in point (1)(b) of
Article 4(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 over a period of 12 consecutive months. Where investment firms
meet any of the thresholds set out in point (1)(b) of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 as from the date
of entry into force of this Directive, the average of their monthly total assets should be calculated taking into
account the 12 consecutive months preceding that date. Those investment firms should apply for authorisation as a
credit institution within one year and one day after the entry into force of this Directive.
(36) The amendment to the definition of ‘credit institution’ in Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 by Regulation (EU) 2019/
2033 may also affect undertakings which have already applied for authorisation as investment firms under
Directive 2014/65/EU and for which the application is still pending. Such applications should be transferred to the
competent authorities under Directive 2013/36/EU and be treated in accordance with the authorisation provisions
set out in that Directive if the envisaged total assets of the undertaking are equal to or exceed any of the thresholds
set out in point (1)(b) of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.
(37) Undertakings referred to in point (1)(b) of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 should also be subject to all
the requirements for access to the activity of credit institutions laid down in Title III of Directive 2013/36/EU,
including the provisions on the withdrawal of authorisation in accordance with Article 18 of that Directive. Article
18 of that Directive should, however, be amended to ensure that competent authorities are able to withdraw the
authorisation granted to a credit institution where that credit institution uses its authorisation exclusively to engage
in the activities referred to in point (1)(b) of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and has, for a period of
five consecutive years, average total assets below the thresholds set out in that point.
(38) Pursuant to Article 39 of Directive 2014/65/EU, third‐country firms providing financial services in the Union are
subject to national regimes which may require the establishment of a branch in a Member State. To facilitate the
regular monitoring and assessment of activities carried out by third‐country firms through branches in the Union,
competent authorities should be informed about the scale and scope of the services and activities carried out
through branches in their territory.

(39) Specific cross‐references in Directives 2009/65/EC (12), 2011/61/EU (13) and 2014/59/EU (14) of the European
Parliament and of the Council to the provisions of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and Directive 2013/36/EU, which
no longer apply to investment firms from the date of application of this Directive and of Regulation (EU) 2019/
2033, should be construed as references to the corresponding provisions in this Directive and in Regulation (EU)
2019/2033.
(40) EBA, in cooperation with ESMA, has issued a report based on thorough background analysis, data collection and
consultation for a bespoke prudential regime for all non‐systemic investment firms, which serves as the basis for the
revised prudential framework for investment firms.
(41) To ensure the harmonised application of this Directive, EBA should develop draft regulatory technical standards to
further specify the criteria to subject certain investment firms to Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, to specify the
information which the competent authorities of home Member States and of host Member States should exchange
in the context of supervision, to set out how investment firms should assess the size of their activities for the
purposes of internal governance requirements and, in particular, to assess whether they constitute small and non‐
interconnected investment firms. Regulatory technical standards should also specify the categories of staff whose
professional activities have a material impact on the risk profile of firms for the purposes of remuneration
provisions, and specify the Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 instruments which qualify as variable remuneration. Finally,
regulatory technical standards should specify the elements for the assessment of specific liquidity risks, the
application of additional own funds requirements by competent authorities, and the functioning of the colleges of
supervisors. The Commission should supplement this Directive by adopting the regulatory technical standards
developed by EBA by means of delegated acts pursuant to Article 290 TFEU and in accordance with Articles 10 to
14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010. The Commission and EBA should ensure that those regulatory technical
standards can be applied by all investment firms concerned in a manner that is proportionate to the nature, scale
and complexity of those investment firms and their activities.
(42) The Commission should also be empowered to adopt implementing technical standards developed by EBA regarding
information sharing between competent authorities and publication requirements of competent authorities and
implementing technical standards developed by ESMA by means of implementing acts pursuant to Article 291
TFEU and in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 and Article 15 of Regulation (EU)
No 1095/2010.
(43) In order to ensure the uniform application of this Directive and to take account of developments in financial
markets, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission to
supplement this Directive by clarifying the definitions in this Directive, the internal capital and risk assessments of
investment firms, and the supervisory review and evaluation powers of competent authorities. It is of particular
importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at
expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinsti­
tutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law‐Making (15). In particular, to ensure equal participation in the

(44) Since the objective of this Directive, namely to set up an effective and proportionate prudential framework to ensure
that investment firms authorised to operate within the Union operate on a sound financial basis and are managed in
an orderly way, including in the best interests of their clients, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States
but can rather, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures,
in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In
accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is
necessary in order to achieve that objective.
(45) In accordance with the Joint Political Declaration of 28 September 2011 of Member States and the Commission on
explanatory documents (16), Member States have undertaken to accompany, in justified cases, the notification of
their transposition measures with one or more documents explaining the relationship between the components of a
directive and the corresponding parts of national transposition instruments. With regard to this Directive, the
legislator considers the transmission of such documents to be justified,

(b) the remuneration policy is a gender‐neutral remuneration policy;

remuneration committee referred to in Article 33 or, where such a committee has not been established, by the

criteria applied to determine the following:
(i) basic fixed remuneration, which primarily reflects relevant professional experience and organisational
responsibility as set out in an employee’s job description as part of his or her terms of employment;
(ii) variable remuneration, which reflects a sustainable and risk adjusted performance of the employee, as well as
performance in excess of the employee’s job description;
(k) the fixed component represents a sufficiently high proportion of the total remuneration so as to enable the operation
of a fully flexible policy on variable remuneration components, including the possibility of paying no variable
remuneration component.

2009/384/EC (26) as well as existing remuneration guidelines pursuant to Directives 2009/65/EC, 2011/61/EU and
2014/65/EU, and shall aim to minimise divergence from existing provisions.
EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 26 June 2021.
Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Directive by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred
to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.

Investment firms that benefit from extraordinary public financial support
Member States shall ensure that where an investment firm benefits from extraordinary public financial support as defined

combination of the assessment of the performance of the individual, of the business unit concerned and of the overall
results of the investment firm;
(b) when assessing the performance of the individual, both financial and non‐financial criteria are taken into account;
(c) the assessment of the performance referred to in point (a) is based on a multi‐year period, taking into account the

types of current and future risks and the cost of the capital and liquidity required in accordance with Regulation (EU)
2019/2033;
(i) the allocation of the variable remuneration components within the investment firm takes into account all types of

(l) at least 40 % of the variable remuneration is deferred over a three‐ to five‐year period as appropriate, depending on the
business cycle of the investment firm, the nature of its business, its risks and the activities of the individual in question,
except in the case of variable remuneration of a particularly high amount where the proportion of the variable
remuneration deferred is at least 60 %;
(m) up to 100 % of the variable remuneration is contracted where the financial performance of the investment firm is
subdued or negative, including through malus or clawback arrangements subject to criteria set by investment firms
which in particular cover situations where the individual in question:
(i) participated in or was responsible for conduct which resulted in significant losses for the investment firm;
(ii) is no longer considered fit and proper;
(n) discretionary pension benefits are in line with the business strategy, objectives, values and long‐term interests of the

creditors and clients. Member States or their competent authorities may place restrictions on the types and designs of
those instruments or prohibit the use of certain instruments for variable remuneration.
For the purposes of point (l) of paragraph 1, the deferral of the variable remuneration shall vest no faster than on a pro‐rata
basis.
For the purposes of point (n) of paragraph 1, where an employee leaves the investment firm before retirement age,
discretionary pension benefits shall be held by the investment firm for a period of five years in the form of instruments
referred to in point (j). Where an employee reaches retirement age and retires, discretionary pension benefits shall be paid
to the employee in the form of instruments referred to in point (j), subject to a five‐year retention period.

its internal organisation, and, where applicable, the characteristics of the group to which it belongs.
6. By way of derogation from point (a) of paragraph 4, a Member State may lower the threshold referred to in that point,
provided that it is appropriate to do so, taking into account the nature and scope of the investment firm’s activities, its
internal organisation, and, where applicable, the characteristics of the group to which it belongs.
7. By way of derogation from point (b) of paragraph 4, a Member State may decide that staff members who are entitled
to annual variable remuneration below the threshold and share referred to in that point shall not be subject to the
exemption set out therein because of national market specificities in terms of remuneration practices or because of the
nature of the responsibilities and job profile of those staff members.
8. EBA, in consultation with ESMA, shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the classes of
instruments that satisfy the conditions set out in point (j)(iii) of paragraph 1 and to specify possible alternative
arrangements set out in point (k) of paragraph 1.
EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 26 June 2021.

and independent judgment on remuneration policies and practices and the incentives created for managing risk, capital
and liquidity. The remuneration committee may be established at group level.
2. Member States shall ensure that the remuneration committee is responsible for the preparation of decisions regarding
remuneration, including decisions which have implications for the risk and risk management of the investment firm
concerned and which are to be taken by the management body. The Chair and the members of the remuneration
committee shall be members of the management body who do not perform any executive function in the investment firm
concerned. Where employee representation in the management body is provided for by national law, the remuneration
committee shall include one or more employee representatives.

public interest and the long‐term interests of shareholders, investors and other stakeholders in the investment firm.
Article 34
Oversight of remuneration policies
1. Member States shall ensure that competent authorities collect the information disclosed in accordance with points (c)
and (d) of the first subparagraph of Article 51 of Regulation (EU) 2019/2033 as well as the information provided by
investment firms on the gender pay gap and use that information to benchmark remuneration trends and practices.
5.12.2019 E N O f f i c i a l J o u r n a l o f t h e E u r o p e a n Union L 314/91
Competent authorities shall provide that information to EBA.
2. EBA shall use information received from the competent authorities in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 4 to
benchmark remuneration trends and practices at Union level.
3. EBA, in consultation with ESMA, shall issue guidelines on the application of sound remuneration policies. Those
guidelines shall take into account at least the requirements referred to in Articles 30 to 33 and principles on sound
remuneration policies set out in Recommendation 2009/384/EC.
4. Member States shall ensure that investment firms provide competent authorities with information on the number of
natural persons per investment firm that are remunerated EUR 1 million or more per financial year, in pay brackets of EUR
1 million, including information on their job responsibilities, the business area involved and the main elements of salary,
bonus, long‐term award and pension contribution.
Member States shall ensure that investment firms provide competent authorities, upon demand, the total remuneration
figures for each member of the management body or senior management.
Competent authorities shall forward the information referred to in the first and second subparagraphs to EBA, which shall
publish it on an aggregate home Member State basis in a common reporting format. EBA, in consultation with ESMA, may
issue guidelines to facilitate the implementation of this paragraph and to ensure the consistency of the information
collected.
Article 35
EBA report on environmental, social, and governance risks
EBA shall prepare a report on the introduction of technical criteria related to exposures to activities associated substantially
with environmental, social, and governance (ESG) objectives for the supervisory review and evaluation process, with a view
to assessing the possible sources and effects of risks on investment firms, taking into account applicable Union legal acts in
the field of ESG taxonomy.
The EBA report referred to in the first paragraph shall comprise at least the following:
(a) a definition of ESG risks, including physical risks and transition risks related to the transition to a more sustainable
economy, and, with regard to transition risks, including risks related to the depreciation of assets due to regulatory
change, qualitative and quantitative criteria and metrics relevant for assessing such risks, as well as a methodology for
assessing the possibility of such risks arising in the short, medium, or long term and the possibility of such risks
having a material financial impact on an investment firm;
(b) an assessment of the possibility of significant concentrations of specific assets increasing ESG risks, including physical
risks and transition risks for an investment firm;
(c) a description of the processes by means of which an investment firm can identify, assess, and manage ESG risks,
including physical risks and transition risks;
(d) the criteria, parameters and metrics by means of which supervisors and investment firms can assess the impact of
short‐, medium‐ and long‐term ESG risks for the purposes of the supervisory review and evaluation process.
EBA shall submit the report on its findings to the European Parliament, to the Council, and to the Commission, by 26
December 2021.
On the basis of that report, EBA may, if appropriate, adopt guidelines to introduce criteria related to ESG risks for the
supervisory review and evaluation process that take into account the findings of the EBA report referred to in this Article.

Section 3
Supervisory review and evaluation process
Article 36
Supervisory review and evaluation
1. Competent authorities shall review, to the extent relevant and necessary, taking into account the investment firm’s
size, risk profile and business model, the arrangements, strategies, processes and mechanisms implemented by investment
firms to comply with this Directive and with Regulation (EU) 2019/2033 and evaluate the following as appropriate and
relevant, so as to ensure a sound management and coverage of their risks:
(a) the risks referred to in Article 29;
(b) the geographical location of an investment firm’s exposures;
(c) the business model of the investment firm;
(d) the assessment of systemic risk, taking into account the identification and measurement of systemic risk under Article
23 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 or recommendations of the ESRB;
(e) the risks posed to the security of investment firms’ network and information systems to ensure confidentiality, integrity
and availability of their processes, data and assets;
(f) the exposure of investment firms to the interest rate risk arising from non‐trading book activities;
(g) governance arrangements of investment firms and the ability of members of the management body to perform their
duties.
For the purposes of this paragraph, competent authorities shall duly take into account whether investment firms hold a
professional indemnity insurance.
2. Member States shall ensure that competent authorities establish the frequency and intensity of the review and
evaluation referred to in paragraph 1, having regard to the size, nature, scale and complexity of the activities of the
investment firms concerned and, where relevant, their systemic importance, and taking into account the principle of
proportionality.
Competent authorities shall decide on a case‐by‐case basis whether and in which form the review and evaluation is to be
carried out with regard to investment firms that meet the conditions for qualifying as small and non‐interconnected
investment firms set out in Article 12(1) of Regulation (EU) 2019/2033, only where they deem it to be necessary due to
the size, nature, scale and complexity of the activities of those investment firms.
For the purposes of the first subparagraph, national law governing segregation applicable to client money held shall be
considered.
3. When conducting the review and evaluation referred to in point (g) of paragraph 1, competent authorities shall have
access to agendas, minutes and supporting documents for meetings of the management body and its committees, and the
results of the internal or external evaluation of the performance of the management body.
4. The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 58 to supplement this Directive to
ensure that the arrangements, strategies, processes and mechanisms of investment firms ensure a sound management and
coverage of their risks. The Commission shall thereby take into account developments in financial markets, and in
particular the emergence of new financial products, developments in accounting standards and developments that
facilitate the convergence of supervisory practices.
Article 37
Ongoing review of the permission to use internal models
1. Member States shall ensure that competent authorities review on a regular basis, and at least every three years,
investment firms’ compliance with the requirements for the permission to use internal models as referred to in Article 22
of Regulation (EU) 2019/2033. Competent authorities shall in particular have regard to changes in an investment firm’s
business and to the implementation of those internal models to new products, and review and assess whether the
investment firm uses well‐developed and up‐to‐date techniques and practices for those internal models. Competent
5.12.2019 E N O f f i c i a l J o u r n a l o f t h e E u r o p e a n Union L 314/93
authorities shall ensure that material deficiencies identified in the coverage of risk by an investment firm’s internal models
are rectified, or take steps to mitigate their consequences, including by imposing capital add‐ons or higher multiplication
factors.
2. Where, for internal risk‐to‐market models, numerous overshootings as referred to in Article 366 of Regulation (EU)
No 575/2013 indicate that the internal models are not or are no longer accurate, competent authorities shall revoke the
permission to use the internal models or impose appropriate measures to ensure that the internal models are improved
promptly within a set timeframe.
3. Where an investment firm that has been granted permission to use internal models no longer meets the requirements
for applying those internal models, competent authorities shall require the investment firm either to demonstrate that the
effect of non‐compliance is immaterial or to present a plan and a deadline to comply with those requirements. Competent
authorities shall require improvements to the presented plan where that plan is unlikely to result in full compliance or
where the deadline is inappropriate.
Where it is unlikely that the investment firm will comply by the prescribed deadline or has not satisfactorily demonstrated
that the effect of non‐compliance is immaterial, Member States shall ensure that competent authorities revoke the
permission to use internal models or limit it to compliant areas or to those areas where compliance can be achieved by an
appropriate deadline.
4. EBA shall analyse internal models across investment firms and shall analyse how investment firms using internal
models treat similar risks or exposures. It shall inform ESMA thereof.
In order to promote consistent, efficient and effective supervisory practices, EBA shall, on the basis of that analysis and in
accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, develop guidelines with benchmarks on how investment
firms are to use internal models and how those internal models are to be applied to similar risks or exposures.
Member States shall encourage competent authorities to take into account that analysis and those guidelines for the review
referred to in paragraph 1.
Section 4
Supervisory measures and powers
Article 38
Supervisory measures
Competent authorities shall require investment firms to take, at an early stage, the measures necessary to address the
following problems:
(a) an investment firm does not meet the requirements of this Directive or of Regulation (EU) 2019/2033;
(b) competent authorities have evidence that an investment firm is likely to breach the national provisions transposing this
Directive or the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2019/2033 within the next 12 months.
Article 39
Supervisory powers
1. Member States shall ensure that competent authorities have the necessary supervisory powers to intervene in the
exercise of their functions into the activity of investment firms in an effective and proportionate way.
2. For the purposes of Article 36, Article 37(3) and Article 38 and of the application of Regulation (EU) 2019/2033,
competent authorities shall have the following powers:
L 314/94 E N O f f i c i a l J o u r n a l o f t h e E u r o p e a n Union 5.12.2019
(a) to require investment firms to have own funds in excess of the requirements set out in Article 11 of Regulation (EU)
2019/2033, under the conditions laid down in Article 40 of this Directive, or to adjust the own funds and liquid
assets required in case of material changes in the business of those investment firms;
(b) to require the reinforcement of the arrangements, processes, mechanisms and strategies implemented in accordance
with Articles 24 and 26;
(c) to require investment firms to present, within one year, a plan to restore compliance with supervisory requirements
pursuant to this Directive and to Regulation (EU) 2019/2033, to set a deadline for the implementation of that plan
and require improvements to that plan regarding scope and deadline;
(d) to require investment firms to apply a specific provisioning policy or treatment of assets in terms of own funds
requirements;
(e) to restrict or limit the business, operations or network of investment firms or to request the divestment of activities
that pose excessive risks to the financial soundness of an investment firm;
(f) to require the reduction of the risk inherent in the activities, products and systems of investment firms, including
outsourced activities;
(g) to require investment firms to limit variable remuneration as a percentage of net revenues where that remuneration is
inconsistent with the maintenance of a sound capital base;
(h) to require investment firms to use net profits to strengthen own funds;
(i) to restrict or prohibit distributions or interest payments by an investment firm to shareholders, members or holders of
Additional Tier 1 instruments where that restriction or prohibition does not constitute an event of default of the
investment firm;
(j) to impose additional or more frequent reporting requirements to those set out in this Directive and Regulation (EU)
2019/2033, including reporting on capital and liquidity positions;
(k) to impose specific liquidity requirements in accordance with Article 42;
(l) to require additional disclosures;
(m) to require investment firms to reduce the risks posed to the security of investment firms’ network and information
systems to ensure confidentiality, integrity and availability of their processes, data and assets;
3. For the purposes of point (j) of paragraph 2, competent authorities may only impose additional or more frequent
reporting requirements on investment firms where the information to be reported is not duplicative and one of the
following conditions is met:
(a) one of the cases referred to in points (a) and (b) of Article 38 applies;
(b) the competent authority considers it to be necessary to gather the evidence referred to in point (b) of Article 38;
(c) the additional information is required for the purpose of the supervisory review and evaluation process referred to in
Article 36.
Information shall be deemed to be duplicative where the competent authority already has the same or substantially the
same information, where that information is capable of being produced by the competent authority or of being obtained
by the same competent authority through other means than a requirement on the investment firm to report it. A
competent authority shall not require additional information where the information is available to the competent
authority in a different format or level of granularity than the additional information to be reported and that different
format or granularity does not prevent it from producing substantially similar information.
Article 40
Additional own funds requirement
1. Competent authorities shall impose the additional own funds requirement referred to in point (a) of Article 39(2)
only where, on the basis of the reviews carried out in accordance with Articles 36 and 37, they ascertain any of the
following situations for an investment firm:
(a) the investment firm is exposed to risks or elements of risks, or poses risks to others that are material and are not
covered or not sufficiently covered by the own funds requirement, and especially K‐factor requirements, set out in Part
Three or Four of Regulation (EU) 2019/2033;
5.12.2019 E N O f f i c i a l J o u r n a l o f t h e E u r o p e a n Union L 314/95
(b) the investment firm does not meet the requirements set out in Articles 24 and 26 and other supervisory measures are
unlikely to sufficiently improve the arrangements, processes, mechanisms and strategies within an appropriate
timeframe;
(c) the adjustments in relation to the prudent valuation of the trading book are insufficient to enable the investment firm
to sell or hedge out its positions within a short period without incurring material losses under normal market
conditions;
(d) the review carried out in accordance with Article 37 shows that non‐compliance with the requirements for the
application of the permitted internal models will likely lead to inadequate levels of capital;
(e) the investment firm repeatedly fails to establish or maintain an adequate level of additional own funds as set out in
Article 41.
2. For the purposes of point (a) of paragraph 1 of this Article, risks or elements of risks shall be considered not to be
covered or to be insufficiently covered by the own funds requirements set out in Parts Three and Four of Regulation (EU)
2019/2033 only where the amounts, types and distribution of capital considered adequate by the competent authority
following the supervisory review of the assessment carried out by investment firms in accordance with Article 24(1) of
this Directive are higher than the investment firm’s own funds requirement set out in Part Three or Four of Regulation
(EU) 2019/2033.
For the purposes of the first subparagraph, the capital considered to be adequate may include risks or elements of risks that
are explicitly excluded from the own funds requirement set out in Part Three or Four of Regulation (EU) 2019/2033.
3. Competent authorities shall determine the level of the additional own funds required pursuant to point (a) of Article
39(2) as the difference between the capital considered adequate pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Article and the own funds
requirement set out in Part Three or Four of Regulation (EU) 2019/2033.
4. Competent authorities shall require investment firms to meet the additional own funds requirement referred to in
point (a) of Article 39(2) with own funds subject to the following conditions:
(a) at least three quarters of the additional own funds requirement is met with Tier 1 capital;
(b) at least three quarters of the Tier 1 capital is composed of Common Equity Tier 1 capital;
(c) those own funds are not used to meet any of the own funds requirements set out in points (a), (b) and (c) of Article 11
(1) of Regulation (EU) 2019/2033.
5. Competent authorities shall substantiate in writing their decision to impose an additional own funds requirement as
referred to in point (a) of Article 39(2) by giving a clear account of the full assessment of the elements referred to in
paragraphs 1 to 4 of this Article. That includes, in the case set out in point (d) of paragraph 1 of this Article, a specific
statement of why the level of capital established in accordance with Article 41(1) is no longer considered sufficient.
6. EBA, in consultation with ESMA, shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify how the risks and
elements of risks referred to in paragraph 2 are to be measured, including risks or elements of risks that are explicitly
excluded from the own funds requirements set out in Part Three or Four of Regulation (EU) 2019/2033.
EBA shall ensure that the draft regulatory technical standards include indicative qualitative metrics for the amounts of
additional own funds referred to in point (a) of Article 39(2), taking into account the range of different business models
and legal forms that investment firms may take, and are proportionate in light of:
(a) the implementation burden on investment firms and competent authorities;
(b) the possibility that the higher level of own funds requirements that apply where investment firms do not use internal
models justifies the imposition of lower own funds requirements when assessing risks and elements of risks in
accordance with paragraph 2.
EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 26 June 2021.
Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Directive by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred
to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.
7. Competent authorities may impose an additional own funds requirement in accordance with paragraphs 1 to 6 on
investment firms that meet the conditions for qualifying as small and non‐interconnected investment firms set out in
Article 12(1) of Regulation (EU) 2019/2033 on the basis of a case‐by‐case assessment and where the competent authority
deems it to be justified.

Article 41
Guidance on additional own funds
1. Taking into account the principle of proportionality and commensurate with the size, systemic importance, nature,
scale and complexity of activities of investment firms that do not meet the conditions for qualifying as small and non‐
interconnected investment firms set out in Article 12(1) of Regulation (EU) 2019/2033, competent authorities may
require such investment firms to have levels of own funds which, based on Article 24, are sufficiently above the
requirements set out in Part Three of Regulation (EU) 2019/2033 and in this Directive, including the additional own funds
requirements referred to in point (a) of Article 39(2), to ensure that cyclical economic fluctuations do not lead to a breach
of those requirements or threaten the ability of the investment firm to wind down and cease activities in an orderly manner;
2. Competent authorities shall, where appropriate, review the level of own funds that has been set by each investment
firm that does not meet the conditions for qualifying as a small and non‐interconnected investment firm set out in Article
12(1) of Regulation (EU) 2019/2033, in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article and, where relevant, shall
communicate the conclusions of that review to the investment firm concerned, including any expectation for adjustments
to the level of own funds established in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article. Such a communication shall include
the date by which the competent authority requires the adjustment to be completed.
Article 42
Specific liquidity requirements
1. Competent authorities shall impose the specific liquidity requirements referred to in point (k) of Article 39(2) of this
Directive only where, on the basis of the reviews carried out in accordance with Articles 36 and 37 of this Directive, they
conclude that an investment firm that does not meet the conditions for qualifying as a small and non‐interconnected
investment firm set out in Article 12(1) of Regulation (EU) 2019/2033 or that meets the conditions set out in Article 12
(1) of Regulation (EU) 2019/2033 but has not been exempted from liquidity requirement in accordance with Article 43(1)
of Regulation (EU) 2019/2033 is in one of the following situations:

CHAPTER 3
Supervision of investment firm groups
Section 1
Supervision of investment firm groups on a consolidated basis and supervision of
compliance with the group capital test
Article 46
Determination of the group supervisor
1. Member States shall ensure that, where an investment firm group is headed by a Union parent investment firm,
supervision on a consolidated basis or supervision of compliance with the group capital test is exercised by the competent
authority of that Union parent investment firm.
2. Member States shall ensure that, where the parent undertaking of an investment firm is a Union parent investment
holding company or a Union parent mixed financial holding company, supervision on a consolidated basis or supervision
of compliance with the group capital test is exercised by the competent authority of that investment firm.
3. Member States shall ensure that, where two or more investment firms authorised in two or more Member States have
the same Union parent investment holding company or the same Union parent mixed financial holding company,
supervision on a consolidated basis or supervision of compliance with the group capital test is exercised by the competent
authority of the investment firm authorised in the Member State in which the investment holding company or mixed
financial holding company is established.
4. Member States shall ensure that, where the parent undertakings of two or more investment firms authorised in two
or more Member States comprise more than one investment holding company or mixed financial holding company with
head offices in different Member States and where there is an investment firm in each of those Member States, supervision
on a consolidated basis or supervision of compliance with the group capital test shall be exercised by the competent
authority of the investment firm with the largest balance sheet total.
5. Member States shall ensure that, where two or more investment firms authorised in the Union have as their parent
the same Union investment holding company or Union mixed financial holding company and none of those investment
firms has been authorised in the Member State in which the investment holding company or mixed financial holding
company was set up, supervision on a consolidated basis or supervision of compliance with the group capital test is
exercised by the competent authority of the investment firm with the largest balance sheet total.
6. Competent authorities may, by common agreement, waive the criteria referred to in paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 where
their application would not be appropriate for the effective supervision on a consolidated basis or supervision of
compliance with the group capital test, taking into account the investment firms concerned and the importance of their
activities in the relevant Member States, and designate a different competent authority to exercise supervision on a
consolidated basis or supervision of compliance with the group capital test. In those cases, competent authorities shall,
before adopting any such decision, give the Union parent investment holding company or Union parent mixed financial
holding company or investment firm with the largest balance sheet total, as appropriate, an opportunity to state its
opinion on that intended decision. Competent authorities shall notify the Commission and EBA of any such decision.
Article 47
Information requirements in emergency situations
Where an emergency situation arises, including a situation as described in Article 18 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 or a
situation of adverse developments in markets, which potentially jeopardises the market liquidity and the stability of the
financial system in any of the Member States where entities of an investment firm group have been authorised, the group
supervisor determined pursuant to Article 46 of this Directive shall, subject to Section 2 of Chapter 1 of this Title, alert, as
soon as practicable, EBA, ESRB and any relevant competent authorities and shall communicate all information essential for
the performance of their tasks.

Article 48
Colleges of supervisors
1. Member States shall ensure that the group supervisor determined pursuant to Article 46 of this Directive may, if
appropriate, establish colleges of supervisors to facilitate the exercise of the tasks referred to in this Article and to ensure
coordination and cooperation with relevant third‐country supervisory authorities in particular where this is needed for the
purpose of applying point (c) of the first subparagraph of Article 23(1) and Article 23(2) of Regulation (EU) 2019/2033 to
exchange and update relevant information on the margin model with the supervisory authorities of the qualifying central

part of the same group need to request either from the competent authority of a clearing member’s home Member
State or from the competent authority of the QCCP information relating to the margin model and parameters used for
the calculation of the margin requirement of the relevant investment firms;
(d) the exchange of information between all competent authorities and with EBA in accordance with Article 21 of

(e) reaching an agreement on the voluntary delegation between competent authorities of tasks and responsibilities, where
appropriate;
(f) increasing the efficiency of supervision by seeking to avoid the unnecessary duplication of supervisory requirements.
3. Where appropriate, colleges of supervisors may also be established where subsidiaries of an investment firm group
headed by an Union investment firm, Union parent investment holding company or Union parent mixed financial holding
company are located in a third country.
4. EBA shall, in accordance with Article 21 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, participate in the meetings of the

Union investment firm, Union parent investment holding company or Union parent mixed financial holding company;
(b) where appropriate, third‐country supervisory authorities, subject to confidentiality requirements that are equivalent in

supervisor shall also keep all the members of the college of supervisors fully informed, in a timely manner, of the decisions
adopted in those meetings or the measures carried out.
The group supervisor shall take account of the relevance of the supervisory activity to be planned or coordinated by the
authorities referred to in paragraph 5 when adopting decisions.

least one of its subsidiaries is a credit institution, supervision on a consolidated basis shall be exercised by the
competent authority of the credit institution, or where there are several credit institutions, the credit institution with
the largest balance sheet total.
2. Where the parent of a credit institution or investment firm is a parent financial holding company in a Member
State, a parent mixed financial holding company in a Member State, an EU parent financial holding company or an
