Before requiring an institution to resubmit a recovery plan the competent authority shall give the institution the opportunity to state its opinion on that requirement . Where the competent authority does not consider the deficiencies and impediments to have been adequately addressed by the revised plan , it may direct the institution to make specific changes to the plan . 6 . If the institution fails to submit a revised recovery plan , or if the competent authority determines that the revised recovery plan does not adequately remedy the deficiencies or potential impediments', 'on funding conditions , or on the wider economy in the context of recovery and resolution plans and when using the different powers and tools at their disposal , making sure that the regime is applied in an appropriate and proportionate way and that the administrative burden relating to the recovery and resolution plan preparation obligations is minimised . Whereas the contents and information specified in this Directive and in Annexes A , B and C establish a minimum standard for institutions with evident systemic relevance , authorities are permitted to apply different or significantly reduced recovery and resolution planning and information requirements on an institutionspecific basis , and at a lower frequency for updates than one year . For a small institution of little interconnectedness and complexity , a recovery plan could be reduced to some basic information on its structure , triggers for recovery actions and recovery options . If an institution could EN L 173192 Official Journal of the European Union 12.6.2014 ( 1 ) Regulation ( EU ) No 5752013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms and amending Regulation ( EU ) No 6482012 ( OJ L 176 , 27.6.2013 , p. 1 ) . ( 2 ) Directive 201336EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on access to the activity of credit institutions and the prudential supervision of credit institutions and investment firms , amending Directive 200287EC and repealing Directives 200648EC and 200649EC ( OJ L 176 , 27.6.2013 , p. 338 ) . ( 3 ) Directive 200287EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2002 on the supplementary supervision of credit institutions , insurance undertakings and investment firms in a financial conglomerate and amending Council Directives 73239EEC , 79267EEC , 9249EEC , 9296EEC , 936EEC and 9322EEC , and Directives 9878EC and 200012EC of the European Parliament and of the Council ( OJ L 35 , 11.2.2003 , p. 1 ) . ( 4 ) Regulation ( EU ) No 6482012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 July 2012 on OTC derivatives , central counter parties and trade repositories ( OJ L 201 , 7.2.2012 , p. 1 ) . be permitted to go insolvent , then the resolution plan could be reduced . Further , the regime should be applied so that the stability of financial markets is not jeopardised . In particular , in situations characterised by broader problems or even doubts about the resilience of many institutions , it is essential that authorities consider the risk of contagion from the actions taken in relation to any individual institution . ( 15 ) In order to ensure the required speed of action , to guarantee independence from economic actors and to avoid conflicts of interest , Member States should appoint public administrative authorities or authorities entrusted with public administrative powers to perform the functions and tasks in relation to resolution pursuant to this Directive . Member States should ensure that appropriate resources are allocated to those resolution authorities . The desig nation of public authorities should not exclude delegation under the responsibility of a resolution authority . However , it is not necessary to prescribe the type of authority or authorities that Member States should appoint as a resolution authority . While harmonisation of that aspect may facilitate coordination , it would considerably interfere with the constitutional and administrative systems of Member States . A sufficient degree of coordination can still be achieved with a less intrusive requirement all the national authorities involved in the resolution of institutions should be represented in resolution colleges , where coordination at crossborder or Union level should take place . Member States should therefore be free to choose which authorities should be responsible for applying the resolution tools and exercising the powers laid down in this Directive . Where a Member State designates the authority responsible for the prudential supervision of institutions ( competent authority ) as a resolution authority , adequate structural arrangements should be put in place to separate the supervisory and resolution functions . That separation should not prevent the resolution function from having access to any information available to the supervisory function . ( 16 ) In light of the consequences that the failure of an institution may have on the financial system and the economy of a Member State as well as the possible need to use public funds to resolve a crisis , the Ministries of Finance or other relevant ministries in the Member States should be closely involved , at an early stage , in the process of crisis management and resolution . ( 17 ) Effective resolution of institutions or group entities operating across the Union requires cooperation among competent authorities and resolution authorities within supervisory and resolution colleges at all the stages covered by this Directive , from the preparation of recovery and resolution plans to the actual resolution of an institution . In the event of disagreement between national authorities on decisions to be taken in accordance with this Directive with regard to institutions , the European Supervisory Authority ( European Banking Authority ) ( EBA ) , established by Regulation ( EU ) No 10932010 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 1 ) should , where specified in this Directive , as a last resort , play a mediation role . In certain cases , this Directive provides for binding mediation by EBA in accordance with Article 19 of Regulation ( EU ) No 10932010 . Such binding mediation does not prevent nonbinding mediation in accordance with Article 31 of Regulation ( EU ) No 10932010 in other cases . ( 18 ) In the resolution of institutions or groups operating across the Union , the decisions taken should also aim to preserve financial stability and minimise economic and social effects in', 'appropriate that the exercise of the right of establishment is not directly or indirectly made conditional by Member States to the existence of an agreement to provide financial support . The provisions regarding intragroup financial support in this Directive do not affect contractual or statutory liability arrangements between institutions which protect the participating institutions through crossguarantees and equivalent arrangements . Where a competent authority restricts or prohibits intragroup financial support and where the group recovery plan makes reference to intragroup financial support , such a prohibition or restriction should be considered to be a material change for the purpose of reviewing the recovery plan . ( 39 ) During the recovery and early intervention phases laid down in this Directive , shareholders should retain full responsibility and control of the institution except when a temporary administrator has been appointed by the competent authority . They should no longer retain such a responsibility once the institution has been put under resolution . ( 40 ) In order to preserve financial stability , it is important that competent authorities are able to remedy the deterio ration of an institutions financial and economic situation before that institution reaches a point at which auth orities have no other alternative than to resolve it . To that end , competent authorities should be granted early intervention powers , including the power to appoint a temporary administrator , either to replace or to temporarily work with the management body and senior management of an institution . The task of the temporary adminis trator should be to exercise any powers conferred on it with a view to promoting solutions to redress the financial situation of the institution . The appointment of the temporary administrator should not unduly interfere with rights of the shareholders or owners or procedural obligations established under Union or national company law and should respect international obligations of the Union or Member States , relating to investment protection . The early intervention powers should include those already provided for in Directive 201336EU for circumstances other than those considered to be early intervention as well as other situations considered to be necessary to restore the financial soundness of an institution . ( 41 ) The resolution framework should provide for timely entry into resolution before a financial institution is balance sheet insolvent and before all equity has been fully wiped out . Resolution should be initiated when a competent authority , after consulting a resolution authority , determines that an institution is failing or likely to fail and alternative measures as specified in this Directive would prevent such a failure within a reasonable timeframe . Exceptionally , Member States may provide that , in addition to the competent authority , the determination that the institution is failing or likely to fail can be made also by the resolution authority , after consulting the competent authority . The fact that an institution does not meet the requirements for authorisation should not justify perse the entry into resolution , especially if the institution is still or likely to still be viable . An institution should be considered to be failing or likely to fail when it infringes or is likely in the near future to infringe the requirements for continuing authorisation , when the assets of the institution are or are likely in the near future to be less than its liabilities , when the institution is or is likely in the near future to be unable to pay its debts as they fall due , or when the institution requires extraordinary public financial support except in the particular circumstances laid down in this Directive . The need for emergency liquidity assistance from a central bank should not , per se , be a condition that sufficiently demonstrates that an institution is or will be , in the near future , unable to pay its liabilities as they fall due . EN L 173196 Official Journal of the European Union 12.6.2014 If that facility were guaranteed by a State , an institution accessing such a facility would be subject to the State aid framework . In order to preserve financial stability , in particular in the case of a systemic liquidity shortage , State guarantees on liquidity facilities provided by central banks or State guarantees of newly issued liabilities to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of a Member State should not trigger the resolution framework provided that a number of conditions are met . In particular , the State guarantee measures should be approved under the State aid framework and should not be part of a larger aid package , and the use of the guarantee measures should be strictly limited in time . Member States guarantees for equity claims should be prohibited . When providing a guarantee for newly issued liabilities other than equity , a Member State should ensure that the guarantee is sufficiently remun erated by the institution . Furthermore , the provision of extraordinary public financial support should not trigger resolution where , as a precautionary measure , a Member State takes an equity stake in an institution , including an institution which is publicly owned , which complies with its capital requirements . This may be the case , for example , where an institution is required to raise new capital due to the outcome of a scenariobased stress test or of the equivalent exercise conducted by macroprudential authorities which includes a requirement that is set to maintain financial stability in the context of a systemic crisis , but the institution is unable to raise capital privately in markets . An institution should not be considered to be failing or likely to fail solely on the basis that extraordinary public financial support was provided before the entry into force of this Directive . Finally , access to liquidity facilities including emergency liquidity assistance by central banks may constitute State aid pursuant to the State aid framework . ( 42 )', 'identified in its original assessment , and it is not possible to adequately remedy the deficiencies or impediments through a direction to make specific changes to the plan , the competent authority shall require the institution to identify within a reasonable timeframe changes it can make to its business in order to address the deficiencies in or impediments to the implementation of the recovery plan . If the institution fails to identify such changes within the timeframe set by the competent authority , or if the competent authority assesses that the actions proposed by the institution would not adequately address the deficiencies or impedi ments , the competent authority may direct the institution to take any measures it considers to be necessary and proportionate , taking into account the seriousness of the deficiencies and impediments and the effect of the measures on the institutions business . EN L 173224 Official Journal of the European Union 12.6.2014 The competent authority may , without prejudice to Article 104 of Directive 201336EU , direct the institution to ( a ) reduce the risk profile of the institution , including liquidity risk ( b ) enable timely recapitalisation measures ( c ) review the institutions strategy and structure ( d ) make changes to the funding strategy so as to improve the resilience of the core business lines and critical functions ( e ) make changes to the governance structure of the institution . The list of measures referred to in this paragraph does not preclude Member States from authorising competent auth orities to take additional measures under national law . 7 . When the competent authority requires an institution to take measures according to paragraph 6 , its decision on the measures shall be reasoned and proportionate . The decision shall be notified in writing to the institution and subject to a right of appeal . 8 . EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards specifying the minimum criteria that the competent authority is to assess for the purposes of the assessment of paragraph 2 of this Article and of Article 8 ( 1 ) . EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 3 July 2015 . Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation ( EU ) No 10932010 . Article 7 Group recovery plans 1 . Member States shall ensure that Union parent undertakings draw up and submit to the consolidating supervisor a group recovery plan . Group recovery plans shall consist of a recovery plan for the group headed by the Union parent undertaking as a whole . The group recovery plan shall identify measures that may be required to be implemented at the level of the Union parent undertaking and each individual subsidiary . 2 . In accordance with Article 8 , competent authorities may require subsidiaries to draw up and submit recovery plans on an individual basis . 3 . The consolidating supervisor shall , provided that the confidentiality requirements laid down in this Directive are in place , transmit the group recovery plans to ( a ) the relevant competent authorities referred to in Articles 115 and 116 of Directive 201336EU ( b ) the competent authorities of the Member States where significant branches are located insofar as is relevant to that branch ( c ) the group level resolution authority and ( d ) the resolution authorities of subsidiaries . EN 12.6.2014 Official Journal of the European Union L 173225 4 . The group recovery plan shall aim to achieve the stabilisation of the group as a whole , or any institution of the group , when it is in a situation of stress so as to address or remove the causes of the distress and restore the financial position of the group or the institution in question , at the same time taking into account the financial position of other group entities . The group recovery plan shall include arrangements to ensure the coordination and consistency of measures to be taken at the level of the Union parent undertaking , at the level of the entities referred to in points ( c ) and ( d ) of Article 1 ( 1 ) as well as measures to be taken at the level of subsidiaries and , where applicable , in accordance with Directive 201336EU at the level of significant branches . 5 . The group recovery plan , and any plan drawn up for an individual subsidiary , shall include the elements specified in Article 5 . Those plans shall include , where applicable , arrangements for intragroup financial support adopted pursuant to an agreement for intragroup financial support that has been concluded in accordance with Chapter III . 6 . Group recovery plans shall include a range of recovery options setting out actions to address those scenarios provided for in Article 5 ( 6 ) . For each of the scenarios , the group recovery plan shall identify whether there are obstacles to the implementation of recovery measures within the group , including at the level of individual entities covered by the plan , and whether there are substantial practical or legal impediments to the prompt transfer of own funds or the repayment of liabilities or assets within the group . 7 . The management body of the entity drawing up the group recovery plan pursuant to paragraph 1 shall assess and approve the group recovery plan before submitting it to the consolidating supervisor . Article 8 Assessment of group recovery plans 1 . The consolidating supervisor shall , together with the competent authorities of subsidiaries , after consulting the competent authorities referred to in Article 116 of Directive 201336EU and with the competent authorities of significant branches insofar as is relevant to the significant branch , review the group recovery plan and assess the extent to which it', 'the rest of the financial system is not affected , authorities should be able to exercise their resolution powers without much concern for contagion effects . In a fragile environment , on the other hand , greater care should be exercised to avoid destabilising financial markets . ( 8 ) Resolution of an institution which maintains it as a going concern may , as a last resort , involve government financial stabilisation tools , including temporary public ownership . It is therefore essential to structure the resolution powers and the financing arrangements for resolution in such a way that taxpayers are the beneficiaries of any surplus that may result from the restructuring of an institution that is put back on a safe footing by the authorities . Responsibility and assumption of risk should be accompanied by reward . ( 9 ) Some Member States have already enacted legislative changes that introduce mechanisms to resolve failing insti tutions others have indicated their intention to introduce such mechanisms if they are not adopted at Union level . The absence of common conditions , powers and processes for the resolution of institutions is likely to constitute a barrier to the smooth operation of the internal market and hinder cooperation between national authorities when dealing with failing crossborder groups of institutions . This is particularly true where different approaches mean that national authorities do not have the same level of control or the same ability to resolve institutions . Those differences in resolution regimes may affect the funding costs of institutions differently across Member States and potentially create competitive distortions between institutions . Effective resolution regimes in all Member States are necessary to ensure that institutions can not be restricted in the exercise of the internal market rights of estab lishment by the financial capacity of their home Member State to manage their failure . ( 10 ) Those obstacles should be eliminated and rules should be adopted in order to ensure that the internal market provisions are not undermined . To that end , rules governing the resolution of institutions should be made subject to common minimum harmonisation rules . EN 12.6.2014 Official Journal of the European Union L 173191 ( 11 ) In order to ensure consistency with existing Union legislation in the area of financial services as well as the greatest possible level of financial stability across the spectrum of institutions , the resolution regime should apply to institutions subject to the prudential requirements laid down in Regulation ( EU ) No 5752013 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 1 ) and Directive 201336EU of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 2 ) . The regime should also apply to financial holding companies , mixed financial holding companies provided for in Directive 200287EC of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 3 ) , mixedactivity holding companies and financial institutions , when the latter are subsidiaries of an institution or of a financial holding company , a mixed financial holding company or a mixedactivity holding company and are covered by the supervision of the parent undertaking on a consolidated basis . The crisis has demonstrated that the insolvency of an entity affiliated to a group can rapidly impact the solvency of the whole group and , thus , even have its own systemic implications . Authorities should therefore possess effective means of action with respect to those entities in order to prevent contagion and produce a consistent resolution scheme for the group as a whole , as the insolvency of an entity affiliated to a group could rapidly impact the solvency of the whole group . ( 12 ) To ensure consistency in the regulatory framework , central counterparties , as defined in Regulation ( EU ) No 6482012 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 4 ) and central securities depositories as defined in Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on improving securities settlement in the European Union and on central securities depositories ( CSDs ) and amending Directive 9826EC could be covered by a separate legislative initiative establishing a recovery and resolution framework for those entities . ( 13 ) The use of resolution tools and powers provided for in this Directive may disrupt the rights of shareholders and creditors . In particular , the power of the authorities to transfer the shares or all or part of the assets of an institution to a private purchaser without the consent of shareholders affects the property rights of shareholders . In addition , the power to decide which liabilities to transfer out of a failing institution based upon the objectives of ensuring the continuity of services and avoiding adverse effects on financial stability may affect the equal treatment of creditors . Accordingly , resolution action should be taken only where necessary in the public interest and any interference with rights of shareholders and creditors which results from resolution action should be compatible with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union ( the Charter ) . In particular , where creditors within the same class are treated differently in the context of resolution action , such distinctions should be justified in the public interest and proportionate to the risks being addressed and should be neither directly nor indirectly discriminatory on the grounds of nationality . ( 14 ) Authorities should take into account the nature of an institutions business , shareholding structure , legal form , risk profile , size , legal status and interconnectedness to other institutions or to the financial system in general , the scope and complexity of its activities , whether it is a member of an institutional protection scheme or other cooperative mutual solidarity systems , whether it exercises any investment services or activities and whether its failure and subsequent winding up under normal insolvency proceedings would be likely to have a significant negative effect on financial markets , on other institutions ,']\n",

Whereas the contents and information specified in this Directive and in Annexes A , B and C establish a minimum standard for institutions with evident systemic relevance , authorities are permitted to apply different or significantly reduced recovery and resolution planning and information requirements on an institutionspecific basis , and at a lower frequency for updates than one year . For a small institution of little interconnectedness and complexity , a recovery plan could be reduced to some basic information on its structure , triggers for recovery actions and recovery options . If an institution could EN L 173192 Official Journal of the European Union 12.6.2014 ( 1 ) Regulation ( EU ) No 5752013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms and amending Regulation ( EU ) No 6482012 ( OJ L 176 , 27.6.2013 , p. 1 ) . ( 2 ) Directive 201336EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on access to the activity of credit institutions and the prudential supervision of credit institutions and investment firms , amending Directive 200287EC and repealing Directives 200648EC and 200649EC ( OJ L 176 , 27.6.2013 , p. 338 ) .

Further , the regime should be applied so that the stability of financial markets is not jeopardised . In particular , in situations characterised by broader problems or even doubts about the resilience of many institutions , it is essential that authorities consider the risk of contagion from the actions taken in relation to any individual institution . ( 15 ) In order to ensure the required speed of action , to guarantee independence from economic actors and to avoid conflicts of interest , Member States should appoint public administrative authorities or authorities entrusted with public administrative powers to perform the functions and tasks in relation to resolution pursuant to this Directive . Member States should ensure that appropriate resources are allocated to those resolution authorities . The desig nation of public authorities should not exclude delegation under the responsibility of a resolution authority . However , it is not necessary to prescribe the type of authority or authorities that Member States should appoint as a resolution authority . While harmonisation of that aspect may facilitate coordination , it would considerably interfere with the constitutional and administrative systems of Member States . A sufficient degree of coordination can still be achieved with a less intrusive requirement all the national authorities involved in the resolution of institutions should be represented in resolution colleges , where coordination at crossborder or Union level should take place . Member States should therefore be free to choose which authorities should be responsible for applying the resolution tools and exercising the powers laid down in this Directive . Where a Member State designates the authority responsible for the prudential supervision of institutions ( competent authority ) as a resolution authority , adequate structural arrangements should be put in place to separate the supervisory and resolution functions . That separation should not prevent the resolution function from having access to any information available to the supervisory function . ( 16 ) In light of the consequences that the failure of an institution may have on the financial system and the economy of a Member State as well as the possible need to use public funds to resolve a crisis , the Ministries of Finance or other relevant ministries in the Member States should be closely involved , at an early stage , in the process of crisis management and resolution . ( 17 ) Effective resolution of institutions or group entities operating across the Union requires cooperation among competent authorities and resolution authorities within supervisory and resolution colleges at all the stages covered by this Directive , from the preparation of recovery and resolution plans to the actual resolution of an institution . In the event of disagreement between national authorities on decisions to be taken in accordance with this Directive with regard to institutions , the European Supervisory Authority ( European Banking Authority ) ( EBA ) , established by Regulation ( EU ) No 10932010 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 1 ) should , where specified in this Directive , as a last resort , play a mediation role . In certain cases , this Directive provides for binding mediation by EBA in accordance with Article 19 of Regulation ( EU ) No 10932010 . Such binding mediation does not prevent nonbinding mediation in accordance with Article 31 of Regulation ( EU ) No 10932010 in other cases . ( 18 ) In the resolution of institutions or groups operating across the Union , the decisions taken should also aim to preserve financial stability and minimise economic and social effects in\n",

            "Result 3:\n",
            "appropriate that the exercise of the right of establishment is not directly or indirectly made conditional by Member States to the existence of an agreement to provide financial support . The provisions regarding intragroup financial support in this Directive do not affect contractual or statutory liability arrangements between institutions which protect the participating institutions through crossguarantees and equivalent arrangements . Where a competent authority restricts or prohibits intragroup financial support and where the group recovery plan makes reference to intragroup financial support , such a prohibition or restriction should be considered to be a material change for the purpose of reviewing the recovery plan . ( 39 ) During the recovery and early intervention phases laid down in this Directive , shareholders should retain full responsibility and control of the institution except when a temporary administrator has been appointed by the competent authority . They should no longer retain such a responsibility once the institution has been put under resolution . ( 40 ) In order to preserve financial stability , it is important that competent authorities are able to remedy the deterio ration of an institutions financial and economic situation before that institution reaches a point at which auth orities have no other alternative than to resolve it . To that end , competent authorities should be granted early intervention powers , including the power to appoint a temporary administrator , either to replace or to temporarily work with the management body and senior management of an institution . The task of the temporary adminis trator should be to exercise any powers conferred on it with a view to promoting solutions to redress the financial situation of the institution . The appointment of the temporary administrator should not unduly interfere with rights of the shareholders or owners or procedural obligations established under Union or national company law and should respect international obligations of the Union or Member States , relating to investment protection . The early intervention powers should include those already provided for in Directive 201336EU for circumstances other than those considered to be early intervention as well as other situations considered to be necessary to restore the financial soundness of an institution . ( 41 ) The resolution framework should provide for timely entry into resolution before a financial institution is balance sheet insolvent and before all equity has been fully wiped out . Resolution should be initiated when a competent authority , after consulting a resolution authority , determines that an institution is failing or likely to fail and alternative measures as specified in this Directive would prevent such a failure within a reasonable timeframe . Exceptionally , Member States may provide that , in addition to the competent authority , the determination that the institution is failing or likely to fail can be made also by the resolution authority , after consulting the competent authority . The fact that an institution does not meet the requirements for authorisation should not justify perse the entry into resolution , especially if the institution is still or likely to still be viable . An institution should be considered to be failing or likely to fail when it infringes or is likely in the near future to infringe the requirements for continuing authorisation , when the assets of the institution are or are likely in the near future to be less than its liabilities , when the institution is or is likely in the near future to be unable to pay its debts as they fall due , or when the institution requires extraordinary public financial support except in the particular circumstances laid down in this Directive . The need for emergency liquidity assistance from a central bank should not , per se , be a condition that sufficiently demonstrates that an institution is or will be , in the near future , unable to pay its liabilities as they fall due . EN L 173196 Official Journal of the European Union 12.6.2014 If that facility were guaranteed by a State , an institution accessing such a facility would be subject to the State aid framework . In order to preserve financial stability , in particular in the case of a systemic liquidity shortage , State guarantees on liquidity facilities provided by central banks or State guarantees of newly issued liabilities to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of a Member State should not trigger the resolution framework provided that a number of conditions are met . In particular , the State guarantee measures should be approved under the State aid framework and should not be part of a larger aid package , and the use of the guarantee measures should be strictly limited in time . Member States guarantees for equity claims should be prohibited . When providing a guarantee for newly issued liabilities other than equity , a Member State should ensure that the guarantee is sufficiently remun erated by the institution . Furthermore , the provision of extraordinary public financial support should not trigger resolution where , as a precautionary measure , a Member State takes an equity stake in an institution , including an institution which is publicly owned , which complies with its capital requirements . This may be the case , for example , where an institution is required to raise new capital due to the outcome of a scenariobased stress test or of the equivalent exercise conducted by macroprudential authorities which includes a requirement that is set to maintain financial stability in the context of a systemic crisis , but the institution is unable to raise capital privately in markets . An institution should not be considered to be failing or likely to fail solely on the basis that extraordinary public financial support was provided before the entry into force of this Directive . Finally , access to liquidity facilities including emergency liquidity assistance by central banks may constitute State aid pursuant to the State aid framework . ( 42 )\n",

            "identified in its original assessment , and it is not possible to adequately remedy the deficiencies or impediments through a direction to make specific changes to the plan , the competent authority shall require the institution to identify within a reasonable timeframe changes it can make to its business in order to address the deficiencies in or impediments to the implementation of the recovery plan . If the institution fails to identify such changes within the timeframe set by the competent authority , or if the competent authority assesses that the actions proposed by the institution would not adequately address the deficiencies or impedi ments , the competent authority may direct the institution to take any measures it considers to be necessary and proportionate , taking into account the seriousness of the deficiencies and impediments and the effect of the measures on the institutions business .

In accordance with Article 8 , competent authorities may require subsidiaries to draw up and submit recovery plans on an individual basis . 3 .

The group recovery plan shall include arrangements to ensure the coordination and consistency of measures to be taken at the level of the Union parent undertaking , at the level of the entities referred to in points ( c ) and ( d ) of Article 1 ( 1 ) as well as measures to be taken at the level of subsidiaries and , where applicable , in accordance with Directive 201336EU at the level of significant branches . 5 . The group recovery plan , and any plan drawn up for an individual subsidiary , shall include the elements specified in Article 5 . Those plans shall include , where applicable , arrangements for intragroup financial support adopted pursuant to an agreement for intragroup financial support that has been concluded in accordance with Chapter III . 6 . Group recovery plans shall include a range of recovery options setting out actions to address those scenarios provided for in Article 5 ( 6 ) .

            "the rest of the financial system is not affected , authorities should be able to exercise their resolution powers without much concern for contagion effects . In a fragile environment , on the other hand , greater care should be exercised to avoid destabilising financial markets . ( 8 ) Resolution of an institution which maintains it as a going concern may , as a last resort , involve government financial stabilisation tools , including temporary public ownership . It is therefore essential to structure the resolution powers and the financing arrangements for resolution in such a way that taxpayers are the beneficiaries of any surplus that may result from the restructuring of an institution that is put back on a safe footing by the authorities . Responsibility and assumption of risk should be accompanied by reward . ( 9 ) Some Member States have already enacted legislative changes that introduce mechanisms to resolve failing insti tutions others have indicated their intention to introduce such mechanisms if they are not adopted at Union level . The absence of common conditions , powers and processes for the resolution of institutions is likely to constitute a barrier to the smooth operation of the internal market and hinder cooperation between national authorities when dealing with failing crossborder groups of institutions . This is particularly true where different approaches mean that national authorities do not have the same level of control or the same ability to resolve institutions . Those differences in resolution regimes may affect the funding costs of institutions differently across Member States and potentially create competitive distortions between institutions . Effective resolution regimes in all Member States are necessary to ensure that institutions can not be restricted in the exercise of the internal market rights of estab lishment by the financial capacity of their home Member State to manage their failure . ( 10 ) Those obstacles should be eliminated and rules should be adopted in order to ensure that the internal market provisions are not undermined . To that end , rules governing the resolution of institutions should be made subject to common minimum harmonisation rules . EN 12.6.2014 Official Journal of the European Union L 173191 ( 11 ) In order to ensure consistency with existing Union legislation in the area of financial services as well as the greatest possible level of financial stability across the spectrum of institutions , the resolution regime should apply to institutions subject to the prudential requirements laid down in Regulation ( EU ) No 5752013 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 1 ) and Directive 201336EU of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 2 ) . The regime should also apply to financial holding companies , mixed financial holding companies provided for in Directive 200287EC of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 3 ) , mixedactivity holding companies and financial institutions , when the latter are subsidiaries of an institution or of a financial holding company , a mixed financial holding company or a mixedactivity holding company and are covered by the supervision of the parent undertaking on a consolidated basis . The crisis has demonstrated that the insolvency of an entity affiliated to a group can rapidly impact the solvency of the whole group and , thus , even have its own systemic implications . Authorities should therefore possess effective means of action with respect to those entities in order to prevent contagion and produce a consistent resolution scheme for the group as a whole , as the insolvency of an entity affiliated to a group could rapidly impact the solvency of the whole group . ( 12 ) To ensure consistency in the regulatory framework , central counterparties , as defined in Regulation ( EU ) No 6482012 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 4 ) and central securities depositories as defined in Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on improving securities settlement in the European Union and on central securities depositories ( CSDs ) and amending Directive 9826EC could be covered by a separate legislative initiative establishing a recovery and resolution framework for those entities . ( 13 ) The use of resolution tools and powers provided for in this Directive may disrupt the rights of shareholders and creditors . In particular , the power of the authorities to transfer the shares or all or part of the assets of an institution to a private purchaser without the consent of shareholders affects the property rights of shareholders . In addition , the power to decide which liabilities to transfer out of a failing institution based upon the objectives of ensuring the continuity of services and avoiding adverse effects on financial stability may affect the equal treatment of creditors . Accordingly , resolution action should be taken only where necessary in the public interest and any interference with rights of shareholders and creditors which results from resolution action should be compatible with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union ( the Charter ) . In particular , where creditors within the same class are treated differently in the context of resolution action , such distinctions should be justified in the public interest and proportionate to the risks being addressed and should be neither directly nor indirectly discriminatory on the grounds of nationality . ( 14 ) Authorities should take into account the nature of an institutions business , shareholding structure , legal form , risk profile , size , legal status and interconnectedness to other institutions or to the financial system in general , the scope and complexity of its activities , whether it is a member of an institutional protection scheme or other cooperative mutual solidarity systems , whether it exercises any investment services or activities and whether its failure and subsequent winding up under normal insolvency proceedings would be likely to have a significant negative effect on financial markets , on other institutions ,\n",

            "1. Minimum Requirement for Own Funds and Eligible Liabilities (MREL): Credit institutions are required to maintain a minimum level of own funds and eligible liabilities to absorb losses and ensure the continuity of critical functions in case of failure.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. Resolution Planning: Credit institutions are required to develop and maintain resolution plans to ensure an orderly resolution in the event of failure, minimizing the impact on financial stability and protecting taxpayers from bearing the costs of resolution.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. Early Intervention Measures: The directive provides competent authorities with a set of early intervention measures to prevent the failure of a credit institution.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. Bail-in Tool: The directive introduces a bail-in tool which allows for the write-down or conversion of liabilities of a failing institution into equity, ensuring that shareholders and creditors bear the costs of failure rather than taxpayers.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. Establishment of National Resolution Authorities: Each member state is required to establish a national resolution authority with the necessary powers to apply the resolution tools and exercise the resolution powers provided for in the directive.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. Cooperation and Coordination: The directive provides for cooperation and coordination between national resolution authorities, the European Banking Authority (EBA), and other relevant authorities in the resolution of cross-border groups.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. Recovery Plans: Credit institutions are required to draw up and maintain recovery plans to overcome any form of financial distress.\n",
            "\n",
            "8. Moratorium Power: The directive gives resolution authorities the power to suspend certain contractual obligations of an institution under resolution for a short period of time.\n",
            "\n",
            "9. Stay of Termination Rights: The directive includes provisions that limit the ability of counterparties to terminate contracts with an institution under resolution.\n",
